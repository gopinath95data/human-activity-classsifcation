:purple_circle: This project is based on the data from WISDM Lab of Frodham University, NY - available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

:purple_circle: This model specifically uses only the smartwatch accelerometer readings of the users since it would represent the hand motions of the users. A more robust, complex and accurate model may be built by combinig the accelerometer and gyroscope readings from both the smartphone and smartwatch
